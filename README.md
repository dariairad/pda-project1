### Project Objective

The goal of this project was to simulate a dataset based on a measurable real-world phenomenon for which at least one-hundred data points across at least four different variables could be collected.

Upon investigating the types of variables involved, their likely distributions, and their relationships with each other a data set as closely matching their properties as possible was to be synthesised 

### Notebook Overview

A topic of mental health disorders prevelance in Ireland and the correlation to suicide has been researched for this project. In Ireland 1 in 5 people suffer from mental health disorders, while having a disorder increases risk of dying of suicide five times. 

The data is modelled and synthesised using the numpy.random package in Python. Notebook is separated into the two sections - Research section and Modelling section.
